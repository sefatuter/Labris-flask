# Labris-flask
I deployed a dynamic Flask web app using uWSGI, Nginx, and ModSecurity for enhanced security. The app is containerized and served over HTTPS via Nginx with ModSecurity. Ansible was used to automate the configuration and deployment process, ensuring a consistent setup for uWSGI, Nginx, and security settings.
